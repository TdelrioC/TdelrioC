Hi, I'm Tomás del Río Castro from Chile, I learned to code in college after taking classes in a variety of faculties like sociology, psychology, antrophology,
comunications, bussines/economics and a few more. Coding is the thing I realized could allow me to work in different projects that could fullfill my interests,
and help in different areas.

Now I'm looking for my first job/internship as a developer to hone the abilities I learned at college and see how real life projects and development works.
